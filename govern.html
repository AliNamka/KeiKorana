									<h4>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON THE ETHICAL CONDITION OF THE KHOIKHOI IN PREHISTORIC TIMES, BASED ON THE EVIDENCE OF LANGUAGE.</h4>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
									<p>The Khoikhoi form a branch of the most peculiar and, doubtless, of the most interesting race of all the representatives of mankind on our continent. These Khoi-khoi generally go by the name of Hottentots, and a term to which I must object, as up to this moment it has been the cause of gross misunderstanding and heartburning, especially to ethnologists, when they had in view the classifications of the South African races and nations.
In order to introduce to the reader the worshippers of ‘Tsūi-||goab and to lay a secure basis for the study of the Science of Religion as regards the Khoikhoi branch, I shall endeavour in a short sketch to delineate their prehistoric ethical condition.
When the first European navigators, especially the Dutch, became acquainted with the Cape of Good Hope, they found a yellowish race of men, who possessed large herds of cattle, sheep and goats, and were on the whole, even after they had received a very provoking treatment at the hands of the Europeans, peaceably and hospitably inclined towards strangers.</p>
<p>On account of their curious language abounding in harsh faucal sounds and clicks, the Dutch called them Hottentots. Hottentots or Hüttentüts means in Frisian or Low German a quack, and therefore the old Dutchmen, who were so much puzzled and did not know what to make of such an unheard-of language, more akin to the chat of a parrot than to human speech, called it Hottentot, a mere gibberish. They very little knew that they had before themselves a highly-developed language, so highly, indeed, that the ingenious Martin Haug supposes that its highly a more refined constituents must have been acquired by contact with civilized people.
The old Dutch also did not know that their so-called Hottentots formed only one branch of a wide-spread race, of which the other branch divided into ever so many tribes, differing from each other totally in language, and having only a phonetic relationship, as regards certain peculiar sounds, of which the clicks formed the essential part. This other branch differed also entirely in language from those the Dutch had met first. While the so-called Hottentots called themselves Khoikhoi  (men of men i.c men par excellence), they called those other tribes Sā, the Sonqua of the Cape Records.</p>
<p>This yellow race, consisting of these two branches, inhabited in ancient times the greater part of South Africa, at lest the territory south of the rivers Kunéne and Zambesi.
The appellation Hottentot is now en vogue and as Goethe has it :—
“Wo die Begriffe fehlen,
Da stellt ein Wort zur rechten Zeit sich ein.”
(For there precisely, where ideas fail,
A word comes n most opportunely.)</p> <p>It is useless therefore to extirpate it, for the custom of  more then two centuries has sanctioned its use; and all we can do is to define it more accurately. We should apply the term Hottentot to the whole race, and call the two families, each by their native name, that is the one, Khoikhoi, so-called Hottentot proper; the other the Sãn (Sū) or Bushmen.
In the Nama language, one of the Khoikhoi idioms, the Bushmen are called  Sā-n (com. plur). The meaning of this term is not quite intelligible, and I frankly confess that, after nine years, of which I have spent nearly seven amongst the Khoikhoi, I did not succeed in arriving at a quite satisfactory etymology, and I must still adhere to the interpretation which I first gave in the Globus, 1870, where I traced the word Sā-(b) to the root SA, to inhabit, to be located, to dwell, to be settled, to be quiet. Sā(n) sequently would mean Aborigines or Settlers proper. These Sa-n or Sa-gu-a, Sonqua or Sounqua, &c. (obj. plur. msc.) as they are styled the Cape Records, are often called Bushmen—— the Bossiesman, Bosjesman. Bosmanneken of the Colonial Annals, a name given to them to indicate their adobe and mode of living.
The word Sā(b)has also acquired a low meaning, and is not considered to be very complimentary. The Khoi-khoi often speak of !Uri-Sān (white Bushmen) and mean the low white vagabonds and runaway sailors who visit their country as traders. One also often hears, “Khoihoi tamab, Sam ke,” he is no Khoikhoi , he is a Sā, which means to say, “he is no gentleman, he is of low extraction, or he is a rascal.”  A Nama will say of a man who is very proud and reserved in his manners, who only mixes in good society, “Khoikhoisen  ra sob ke,” the man makes-a-Khoikhoi-of-himself, that is, he stands very much upon his dignity, and also, he keeps himself very much to himself.</p>
<p>Those who desire to have information on the natural and physical condition of the Khoikhoi and Sā-(n), I refer to Dr.Gustav Fritsch’s standard work, “Die Eingeborenen Süd-Africas,” and to three Essays published by me, Die Namas, and Die Buschmänner in the Globus, 1868 and 1870, and Besträge zur Kunde der Hottentot in Jahresbericht des Vereins für Erdkunde Dresden, 1868; not to forget the chapter  on the Hottentot in Friedr. Müller’s excellent work “Allgemeine Ethnographie.”
It is enough meanwhile to say, that the Bushmen lead a life of a Pariah, and that they are hated and chased by all other nations of South Africa, having to suffer most, however, from the hands of their own nearest kith and kin, the Khoikhoi, whom I have, on more than one occasion, seen manifesting more charity for a dog than for a starving Bushman.
The Khoikhoi are generally called, as I have already said, Hottentots, a term to which I would not object, were it not for the confusion it generally brings its train, as far as ethnological, anthropological or linguistic terminology is concerned. Sometimes they are called the Hottentots proper in our Colonial language. But very often, again, our Khoikhoi in the Colony, or more particularly those remnants of the tribes formerly occupying the vicinity of Cape Town, are called Hottentots, Hottentots proper or Cape Hottentots, while the other hand the inhabitants of Griqualand West, of the South Kalihari, of Great Namaqualand are called by their tribal names, Griquas, Namaquas, !Koras or Koranas, just as if they were not Hottentots as much as the Khoikhoi tribes of the Cape Colony. It would be as absurd for us to call only the Prussians, Germans, and apply to all the other tribes of Germany their tribal names, Bavarians, Suabians, Hessians, &c., denying to them the attribute German; or for Londoners to claim for themselves the title of Englishmen, while excluding the Northumberland and Sussexmen from it.</p>
